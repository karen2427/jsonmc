  "storyline": "August Pullman (Jacob Tremblay) is a child born with facial malformations that, up to now, have prevented him from going to school. Auggie becomes the most unlikely of heroes when he enters the fifth grade of the local school, with the support of his parents (Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson). The compassion and acceptance of your new colleagues and the rest of the community will be put to the test, but Auggie's extraordinary journey will unite you all and prove that you can not camouflage yourself when you are born to do something great."
